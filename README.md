QA Involvement in Revamping a Digital Signage System for a Leading Healthcare Provider As part of the QA team supporting the digital transformation of a premier healthcare provider the primary goal was to ensure a seamless, stable, and high-performing digital signage experience across multiple locations. The existing system faced critical issues—frequent crashes, unreliable Windows-based media players, a sluggish and poorly designed web console, and a high dependency on manual intervention. These problems significantly impacted communication with patients and overall operational efficiency. 

**Key QA Contributions:** 

**1. Root Cause Analysis:** Conducted in-depth investigations into recurring system crashes and slow performance to identify hardware-software compatibility issues and memory leaks.
   
**2. End-to-End Testing:** Designed and executed comprehensive test cases covering functionality, UI/UX behavior, media player stability, and cloud-console interactions.
   
**3. Performance Testing:** Simulated real-world usage scenarios to evaluate system responsiveness during peak hours, ensuring media players could handle continuous playback without lag or failure.
   
**4. Regression Testing:** Built automated test suites to ensure new updates did not introduce regressions and that critical functionalities remained intact after each deployment.
   
**5. Cross-Platform Validation:** Ensured compatibility and stability across different operating environments, reducing reliance on high-maintenance Windows-based players.
  
**6. Uptime Monitoring & Recovery Testing:** Verified system resilience by simulating failures and validating automatic recovery mechanisms to minimize manual intervention.

By applying QA best practices throughout the modernization process, the team helped transition the system to a reliable, scalable, and low-maintenance solution—drastically improving communication and user satisfaction within the healthcare environment
